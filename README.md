# gamma-ray-deposition
Semi-analytic and analytic tools for computing the gamma-ray deposition in astrophysical radioactive expanding ejecta, such as Kilonovae and Type Ia supernovae.
The tools were derived and examined in "The thermalization of Î³-rays in radioactive expanding ejecta: A simple model and its application for Kilonovae and Ia SNe", Guttman et al. 2024.

The code is still under construction.
This version allows the use of spherical density profiles rho(v) and rho_rad(v) for ejecta of uniform atomic composition.
Extensions to ejecta with multiple components of different atomic composition, and aspherical density profiles are on the way.
